### `why a URL starts with HTTP`

<h6>This project involves creating a HTTP web server from scratch using C++. The server must be capable of handling HTTP requests, responses and serve static files.</h6>

<strong>Here are some key aspects this project typically coveres:</strong>

<br />

<p><strong>◦  Configuration File Parsing:</strong> <h6>Reading and interpreting configuration files to customize server behavior (e.g., port numbers, root directory, MIME types).</h6></p>

<p><strong>◦  HTTP Protocol Handling:</strong> <h6>Implementing parsing and processing logic for HTTP requests and generating appropriate responses (handling GET, POST, DELETE methods, status codes, headers, etc.).</h6></p>

<p><strong>◦  Socket Programming:</strong> <h6>Understanding and utilizing socket programming to create a network server that listens for incoming connections.</h6></p>

<p><strong>◦  Concurrency and Multi-threading:</strong> <h6>Handling multiple client requests concurrently by implementing multi-threading or other approaches for managing parallel connections.</h6></p>

<p><strong>◦  Error Handling and Logging:</strong> <h6>Implementing error handling mechanisms and logging functionalities for server operations and client interactions.</h6></p>

<p><strong>◦  Security Considerations:</strong> <h6>Basic security measures such as input validation, preventing common attacks (e.g., buffer overflow, DoS), and ensuring proper handling of client requests.</h6></p>

<h5>By the end of this project, I got a hands-on experience in low-level networking concepts, HTTP protocol implementation, and server-side development. and understood the foundational aspects of web servers and HTTP.</h5>
